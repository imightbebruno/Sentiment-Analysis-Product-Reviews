# Sentiment-Analysis-Product-Reviews
This project is a customer sentiment analysis of high-end headphones based on Amazon reviews using the TextBlob library in a Python environment. The analysis focuses on identifying common words associated with the product and evaluating the overall sentiment of customer reviews.

Filtering reviews based on positive and negative sentiment reveals a general trend of customer satisfaction. Out of 100 reviews analyzed, 90% were positive, indicating a high level of customer satisfaction with the product. The remaining 10% were divided between negative (6%) and neutral (4%) reviews.

Analysis of frequently mentioned words revealed a strong focus on sound quality. Words like "sound," "quality," "like," "ANC," "noise," "volume," and "bass" were consistently mentioned, suggesting that sound quality is a critical factor for customers evaluating headphones.

The notable presence of the brand name "Bang & Olufsen" in customer reviews, along with mentions of competitors like "Bose" and "Sony," indicates strong brand awareness among consumers. This suggests that customers are well-informed about available options and actively compare different options.

Insights gained from analyzing common words used in reviews can be valuable for understanding this product's market position. Emphasizing the product's sound quality can guide necessary improvements and inform advertising strategies. Additionally, the analysis highlights the importance of luxury brand perception.

Limitations of this analysis include the relatively small sample size of reviews and the lack of demographic data about the customers, which could be relevant for a luxury brand.
